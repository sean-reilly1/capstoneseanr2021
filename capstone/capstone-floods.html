<p>Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters. It causes more damage than any other natural disasters.Over ½ of the worlds population lives within 60 miles from the ocean , putting them at flood risk 
. Many floods have damage amount set in the multi millions to even billions . </p>
<p> 90 % of natural disasters declared by the president involve some sort of flooding. </p>
<p>Floods are the most common natural hazards in the United States.</p>
<p> Flooding has been getting worse over time in intensity due to global warming.</p>
<p></p>
<p> First of all if you are in a building nearby the sea make sure that you store your valuables on the top floor of your house. This makes them less likely to get water damage.</p>
<p> Make sure that you can place a barrier between your house and any nearby river . This will act as a wall to keep the water out. </p>
<p>Prepare for flooding during other natural disasters such as hurricanes. An example of this is hurricanes where storm surges, that cause flooding.</p>
<p>Living at a higher altitude makes it significantly less likely that you will be injured by a flood. If you live at a low altitude and know that a hurricane or massive rainstorm is coming than it may be a good idea to pack up your valuables and leave for the time being.</p>
<p> Planting trees and bushes make it so that it is far harder for floods to get uphill because it slows down the energy that is forcing the water uphill , and also serves as a type of natural barrier against rising water .</p>

<p>More than four out of every five wildfires are caused by people.</p>
<p> An average of 1.2 million acres of U.S. woodland burn every year.</p>
<p>Lodgepole pines and their closely related jack pines have cones that release their seeds only when they are opened by fire.</p>
<p>Many animals in the food chain benefit when patches of forest are transformed by wildfires into clearings.</p>
<p>Wildfires have been occurring more and more over the years , most recently in the amazon , in california , and in australia. So how can we protect ourselves. </p>
<p> safety tips </p>
<p> The first way is to make sure that you have a gap between your house and the nearby forest. This makes it so that the fire has a harder time jumping between the nearby forest and your house. </p>
<p> Make sure that you don’t have anything that could start a fire next to a woodland area. Only you can prevent forest fires. </p>
<p>Make sure that you have sprinklers in your house in order to minimise damage. This also helps with any fires that you may start by accsedent as well so its just a good idea </p>
<p> As a lesser known fire safety tip make sure that you do not grill within 15 feet of your house as a minimum safe distance. </p>
<p>Avoid having large clumps of dead brush in one area. It makes it easyer for a fire to spread. </p>

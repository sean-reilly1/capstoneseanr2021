<p>A blizzard is a severe snow storm with winds in excess of 35 mph and visibility of less than a 1/4 mile for more than 3 hours.</p>
<p>The first blizzard to be declared a Federal Emergency was in 1977, affecting upstate New York and Southern Ohio. The storm’s accumulation was only about 12 inches over 5 days, but the winds were deadly.</p>
<p>Most snow falls at a speed of between 1 - 4 mph dependent upon the individual snowflake's mass and surface area.</p>
<p>Chionophobia is the word for being afraid of snow.</p>
<p>A ground blizzard occurs after snow has fallen and strong winds blow around loose snow on the ground, creating whiteouts and snowdrifts. 
<p>Safety tips </p>
<p>Preparing yourself for a winter storm primarily involves inspecting your own house. Make sure that there are no cracks or holes where there is no insolation for the heat to escape your house. This primarily involves checking the attic where there is most likely to be a hole , as it can potentially sustain damage from hail. </p>
<p> Another important thing that you have to do is make sure that you are prepared to go outside. Winter clothing such as a coat and gloves are almost always available at local stores and can often be found on sale if they are out of season.</p>
<p>Finaly make sure that you keep up to date on all oil shipments. This is important to keep the house warm , as even a well isolated house loses heat. The oil will alow the heater to warm uo the house for you so that you can stay warm. </p>
<p>If there was hail during the storm make sure to check the house for any damage that may have been caused to the house. This is important because of any damage that may have been caused to pipes, or insolation for the next storm.</p>
<p> Lastly make sure that all of the curtains are closed during a hail storm so that glass does not enter into the house.</p>
